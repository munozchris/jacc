Drucie makes it her goal to introduce you to what her and many other people's lives are like within the Deaf community through language and culture lessons. She is very passionate about teaching us about these things. She also understands which components of ASL and Deaf culture students may struggle with and makes sure to extensively review them.

If you are interested in taking beginners Arabic at UChicago, do everything in your power to get him.

He teaches you Arabic, and he teaches it fast. I feel that I've learned the most Arabic possible and the most useful Arabic possible with him(get his course handout btw- it's like a useful, condensed version of al Kitaab). He can seem kind of intimidating or brusque at first, but he actually gives you a lot of chances and leeway in terms of making up work or tests that you don't finish. Osama was and is a stunning professor, among the very best that I've had at the University of Chicago. He has pushed me to learn the Arabic language better than I ever thought possible, and has kept it so interesting that I'm now planning to take a second year of Arabic, where previously that was never in my plans.

He's excellent with grammar, and he clearly is very passionate about the language. However, he doesn't encourage enough speaking in class, and the quizzes he gives are tests. We call them quiztihans.  Prof Mabra is super enthusiastic about students learning Arabic well, and is always available and happy to meet outside of class.  He also always took time in class to go over things that we collectively struggled on in homework or quizzes. Binary yes or no isn't really a helpful quantifier. He was very good at grammar and knowing the patterns. Less good at conveying them clearly. The class itself could have been better structured with more time to practice the language with other students. In comparing Joshua with every other language teacher I have ever had, he ranks pretty low on the list.  Most of my learning was done on my own/of my own ability to memorize well.  If you want the best language teacher ever, but actually, no joke, then take Muhammad Eissa's first year class if he's back from sabbatical. He's really dedicated to helping students outside the classroom if you need extra help, and even if you don't. He strongly encourages meeting with him to go over grammar points and exams, or if you just want to practice fluency. Always available, though admittedly a bit slow to respond to emails.  Josh clearly knows Arabic very well and has lots of grammar knowledge. However, the class barely focused on conversation. Grammar is important, but conversation/ speaking is priority. We spent a lot of time on highly theoretical grammar (verb forms, vowelling) that is not crucial to learning the language. Seems that priorities were a bit off. He also lets the upper level students dominate class time. ", "LanguageVocabEmphasized&Studied": "Vigorously"}

However, there are a few caveats to his style. He stresses speaking heavily, which is nice if you plan to travel to Egypt (you will only encounter the Egyptian dialect in this class). Otherwise, it takes away from learning reading and writing skills. Furthermore, he does not explain the subtleties of the grammar well. He has an excellent understanding of the grammar, but he has trouble explaining it in terms that are relatable to an English speaker. For first-year Arabic, this is a drawback. Ustadh Eissa is absolutely amazing - he really challenges you to use and broaden your knowledge of Arabic, but In a way that's never threatening or judgmental. One of the kindest and most helpful teachers I have ever had. If you are interested in not just learning how to write Arabic, but how to genuinely speak it, Professor Eissa is the right prof for you!
