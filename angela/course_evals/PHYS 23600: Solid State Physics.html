				<h3 class="eval-title">Please comment on the level of difficulty of the course relative to your background and experience:</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>real chill</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not a very difficult course after stat mech, quantum, and intermediate E&amp;M. I would have preferred if we went into more detail regarding semiconductors, but oh well.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>As a 4th year math physics major this class was not too hard. It was about the same amount of work as stat mech...maybe slightly less.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>This is a course best taken after having completed all of the physics major requirements, as many of the topics apply combinations of quantum, statistical and thermal, and E&amp;M physics, as well as Mechanics.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The course was relatively straightforward and the textbook was understandable and helpful. The TAs and professor collectively explained all the material together.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>4th year physics major w/ 235, 197. Difficulty was fine overall, though I wish we'd gotten a better intuitive explanation of lattice/reciprocal lattice stuff.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Everything was pretty reasonable with the notable exception of the take-home final. Half of the take-home final was graduate-level quantum we'd barely touched on in class and which wasn't in the text book.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I took Statistical and Thermal Physics and that prepared me pretty well for this class, but without that, I know people who took this class without Stat/Therm and did fine.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Hadn't taken stat/therm yet but wasn't too bad</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>As a fourth year physics major who completed the all the core physics classes, the class was at an average difficulty. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Please comment on the strengths of the instructor:</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>chill</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Really clear lectures. Entertaining to listen to. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Really funny. Knows Star Wars trivia really well. Writes clearly on the blackboard.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Tries to connect with students. A decent lecturer when he's discussing physics. Asks students questions.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I guess he's pretty friendly.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Woowon is very funny.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Woowon Kang is the man! Academically, he had very reasonable expectations of the class and was always accommodating to students. He constantly made us laugh and he doesn't take himself or the class seriously enough to be extremely strict/stingy about making up exams, extensions on assignments, etc. He is a flexible professor and has a polarizing (some might say abrasive) but ultimately endearing and goofy personality. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Kang was helpful in and outside of class. He seems very nice.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Please comment on any particular weaknesses of the instructor:</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>maybe too chill</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Always late to class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Woowan is an entertaining guy, but too lax and careless about his teaching. There was not a single class for which he showed up earlier than 10 minutes late, and he often times got off topic by talking about star wars or reminiscing about his undergrad or grad days. He also frequently made mistakes which he had to spend a fair amount of time going back and fixing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Easily distracted. Can't find parking easily.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It's nice that he tries to connect with students, but I think the way he did it messed with the flow of the class rather than keeping people engaged. I would have appreciated the lectures a lot more if there was less crackin' wise--Woowon's a fine lecturer otherwise. (Also "Canadians say 'zed'...I think that's kinda /gay/, amirite?" is uh...really not humor that encourages me to keep coming to class.) </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Kang really needs to work through the examples he's explaining in lecture before class. We would have covered a lot more if he'd been able to utilize lecture time more effectively.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Woowon is sometimes unprepared and pretty much always late.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He was always late to class (not that I cared, because I was too) and sometimes ran out of time for the topics he wanted to cover. He also makes a fair amount of off color/politically incorrect jokes which I found hysterical but could be considered offensive. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Kang would often be late to our classes, and as a result we did not cover a lot of material in the classes. Further, his work on the blackboard would sometimes have mistakes and we would have to refer to the textbook for an accurate derivation. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Please make any other comments that you feel we should know (e.g., what you like most and least about this course):</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The textbook (Simon's Oxford Solid State Basics) is really good. It's pretty reasonable to self-study basically all the non-superconductivity material from it. Which I would recommend if Woowon keeps teaching the class the way he did this year (with way too many lame joke attempts, including kind of gross ones). The ask-the-class aspect is also a bit unfortunate--it's important in principle, and sometimes it helped a lot! But often when the class isn't fully invested it invites some amount of obnoxiousness.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>We spent a few lectures going over the history of superconductivity, which is interesting and all, but I'd much rather we'd spent that time on the physics.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I felt like we did not cover much in the class, and I would like to cover more on solid state. We also spend a lot of time on superconductivity, which was interesting, but I would like build more of a solid state base before exploring the specific topics.</li>
