				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Amazing professor!</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Boaz is really cool</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Boaz is a really cool guy and a great, funny, interesting lecturer.  THIS CLASS AND PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING ARE SOME OF THE BEST UNDERGRAD CLASSES AT UCHICAGO, FOR ANY MAJOR.  No real weaknesses for Boaz.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Keysar is a great lecturer who never fails to keep your attention during class. The only weakness is that it is difficult what to take from each lecture, especially when there are no exams throughout the quarter.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Too harsh a grader</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Boaz is hands down one of my best professors in college. He succeeds immensely at presenting content at a level appropriate to both psychology and non-psychology majors while keeping us all engaged for a 3-hour period. I loved the practical nature of this class with negotiation preparation, hands-on negotiations, and debriefing. The practical exercises such as the Sharpie exercise were also fun.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Best class ever. Interesting lectures. Learn a lot without crazy workload</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Keysar is a FANTASTIC instructor. He's co unbelievably committed to helping his students learn that he puts all of himself into his work. I would highly recommend taking classes with him. I only wish he taught MORE classes. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Probably the best lecturer I've had at UChicago or possibly ever. He has a way of choosing and presenting material that makes a three hour class feel like 50 minutes. 
He has no weakenesses. He just doesn't</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Boaz is da best.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Knowledgeable, funny, and held my attention.  Could have presented lectures a bit more clearly or let us know exactly when the readings should be done by, but overall a really good instructor.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very engaging lecture with interesting and insightful example throughout</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Clear lectures and engaging. Very knowledgable.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Boaz was an incredibly great lecturer, although I feel that a lot of the evidence he uses to make points were not very persuasive or rigorous enough, especially when presenting data from studies.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Liz was another fantastic TA</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Liz is really nice and was really helpful with assignments.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Jason was helpful and straightforward.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Both of the TAs were very helpful in assisting Boaz, but their grading of assignments was a bit harsh, as getting consistent 8/10s are considered fairly good papers, but these only translate into B's</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Good at giving feedback</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Jason provided quick feedback all the time through the quarter and was a fair grader. I just would have liked a little more guidance for the final paper in general.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Liz is really helpful and nice, but she's a comparatively harder grader than Jason, and that didn't help with the class morale. Most of us who did very well on writing assignments last quarter (in decision making) ended up getting lower grades this quarter, and that was kind of hard to deal with and made us feel bitter and like we weren't being treated fairly. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Liz  is strict in her correction of response. You cannot be lax about your work with her. She's a fair TA then.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They were very professional and approachable. They always gave feedback in a timely manner </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Jason is cool.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>We didn't interact with them much because there was no discussion section, but they were quick on grading assignments and very helpful in general.  And as always, Jason is the MAN.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Liz was available outside of class and gave constructive feedback on assignments</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Liz was very willing to help but she was a tough grader.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Make the negotiations count, it should be like 5% of the grade (so not enough to stress people out), but enough to get people to put in effort for the exercises in class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would change the grading system to somehow incorporate how well people do on the negotiations themselves, as the writing assignments were not very useful for the class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More writing assignments, worth a smaller percentage of the grade each. More direction on the final paper</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I think i would benefit as a psych major from a more in-depth consideration of negotiation issues psychologically. The content aims to engage both psych majors and non-psych majors, but the end result is a lot of repetition for psych majors in the course of concepts given all the other electives concerned with behavioral economic-type topics. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I thought this course was kind of boring...I felt I got more out of decision making - but maybe that's just me? I didn't like the three hour seminar format at all. It made the second half very slow and painful as most of us would be getting very sleep around 3 pm (the class is from 1:30-4:20). I also felt like the readings from last quarter were more riveting. I also felt the final paper was not a good measure of our knowledge. I got a good grade, and all, so that's not why I am complaining - it just felt like an extended literary review/summary. I didn't feel like I adequately expressed any new thought. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Really nothing</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Overall I think this course was really well-designed.  The format, with negotiation exercises, the final paper, mini response papers, and mini exercises all seemed to have a purpose and presented a good variety of things we could be graded on.  Short answer: wouldn't change a thing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Meet more than once a week.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The deadlines on the syllabus were planned out in an odd fashion - the last writing response was due well before the end of the class. The final was due during 10th week, even though a finals week deadline would have been a lot better for most people. And, after all,  we have a reading period so we can work on finals - making a final due before reading period seems odd. Also, it wasn't clear to what extent the TA's graded the assignments equally strictly - in a class like this, where there were no TA sessions, perhaps TA's could trade off whose assignments they grade each week so that each student has an equal number of grades given to him/her by each TA? I think this would allow for a fairer grading scheme. Lastly, the negotiation prep sheets were a MAJOR part of my prep for this class, and yet they were only 7% of my grade. Yet, the writing responses, of which there were only 4, were 35%. I think the prep sheets should be weighed more within the grading rubric and perhaps assigned some sort of incomplete/partial completion/completion points, if not an actual grade (there were many of them and they took a significant amount of time).     </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would bring in more guest lecturers, and eliminate the Ultimatum Game simulation</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Is there any topic in this course that you wished you had had previous background in?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>no</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nope.  Good idea to take Psych of Decision Making in the Autumn, that really helps you understand in a theoretical sense and get more out of the class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I had a lot of psychology background, but the class would probably be even more interesting if this wasn't the case.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>None</li>

			<li>All readings useful and reasonable.</li>

			<li>All the weekly readings :)</li>
