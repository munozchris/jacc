				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Amy is a clear lecturer with great knowledge of syntax.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Slava is a great teacher. He's also very friendly and approachable. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Good instructor.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Dahlstrom is very thorough and she methodically works through the required information. However, the class was not super engaging, as it was a lecture course. But that's par for the course I think. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Amy is very knowledgeable about the subject and a clear speaker, but sometimes she can be a little dry. It would be nice to change things up with powerpoints and handouts rather than a full on lecture every time. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>She's very nice and obviously cares a lot about the topic. The problem is the topic is SO BORING and she did very little to hold our attention.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>She gave very clear explanations of the material and was very willing to answer questions.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>She knows a lot about syntax. Like... she knows quite a bit about syntax</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Dr. Dahlstrom is an amazing linguist and always had the background knowledge necessary to explain difficult concepts in context. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Amy was super sweet and really funny in a kind of deadpan way. Amy was very accommodating to student needs and always tried to answer questions to the best of her abilities, although sometimes there would be a question she didnt want to answer and she'd kinda skirt around the subject.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The information was presented at a level beyond my understanding, and sometimes we got off subject. Amy was very knowledgeable about the material, and was very enthusiastic. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Amy knows the topic very well and means well and was able to answer questions, but I got very little out of the lectures. I found them very hard to focus on. It was demoralizing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Amy is super knowledgable and I loved hearing about her work with Meskwaki. She did a really good job of bringing in languages other than English and presented information very clearly. Her lectures were pretty dry a lot of the time though. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Natalia led very good discussion sections that allowed us to practice concepts that we learned in class. Very organized and got assignments back to us with good feedback.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>N/A</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Our TA Anqi was great. She was super helpful, organized the TA session well, and gave us helpful materials. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Natalia was funny, engaging, and willing to think out answers with the students. I love that woman</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very helpful in discussion section and helping with homework</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Anqi didn't always know the answers to our questions right away, probably since she learned syntax in a different framework, but she was very good about getting back to us with the answers to any confusion.  </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They were really nice in helping is talk about the problems we might have</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Anqi was the beeeeeeeest i love her &amp; want her as my TA for everything. She's super funny and nice and always gives good feedback and knows a lot about syntax. However sometimes she might not know the best way to explain something but whatever Anqi is so great</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The discussion sections were my saving grace. They're the only way I was able to accomplish the homework assignments. I found them more useful than lecture.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>My TA was Natalia, who was lovely. She was very accessible and friendly and gave nice feedback on assignments. Weakness would be that she wasn't great at explaining things and didn't seem totally on the same page with what Amy was teaching us exactly.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Perhaps maybe make the problem sets less long since after a point, they became somewhat repititive</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not really. If you like serious syntax, you'll probably like this course. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Make it meet MWF for 50 minutes because that class is way too long to ever pay attention in</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>N/A</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More explanation/practice regarding reflexive pronouns and island constructions-- im still not exactly sure what islands are. I found everything about other frameworks and syntax history to be a waste of time, personally. Maybe explain control/raising verbs better, I didn't understand them until I found a document online that explained them</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Be clearer about terms and definitions being used. Perhaps more interactive than straight lecture. Model lectures closer to the discussion sections.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would step it up a notch in the level of analysis we were expected to do. I appreciated that assignments were super manageable, but also would have appreciated more of a challenge.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Is there any topic in this course that you wished you had had previous background in?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>N/A</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not really. If someone who doesn't know much about syntax can take this class and be successful I think. Which is not to say it's easy, only that it starts basic and then speeds up.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Having taken Intro to Linguistics was helpful</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>generative grammar, but just for my own sake</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing really, it was VERY VERY VERY useful to know another language though</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Syntax</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It helps that this was my last class in the major. Taking semantics &amp; pragmatics prior helped.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nope</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Which texts were most useful?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kroeger</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>We had only one text, and it was useful</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kroeger is great</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>the textbook</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kroeger</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I have to admit I didn't read all the supplementary papers (e.g. the one on island constraints) but they were generally very useful for explaining specific concepts that the textbook couldn't go too deep on.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kroeger is all you need really</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kroeger, even if I couldn't understand most of it</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kroeger (the only textbook) was generally very clear and a good reference. Also the summary packets from the TAs were VERY helpful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Which least?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>N/A</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I guess the readings before the "guest lectures," but those were somewhat useful for understanding those lectures.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>/</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">How productive was class discussion?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>There wasn't much class discussion. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>it was aight</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>So helpful for understaning how to do the homework assignments</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>N/a</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Tangential information was nice to have actually. Those were the real tidbits</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Class was very quiet until an example came up where some people thought it was ungrammatical and others thought it was fine. Those debates were funny. Discussion section was really helpful, we got super useful summary sheets about the topic for that week.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They were very low morale, not interesting and hard to follow. I found we were operating with definitions and terms that hadn't been clearly laid out. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>We didn't discuss a whole lot. I actually quite appreciated attempts to get us to talk since there's not a ton of room for opinion in the subject. People read aloud examples in languages that they spoke and we had some little discussions over whether sentences were grammatical.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">How has this course contributed to your education?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Enhanced my analytic skills and knowledge of syntactic topics across various languages</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I felt like we covered a lot of syntax topics in this class, and I also got a better sense of whether I wanted to commit fully to a linguistics major. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Gave me an appreciation for syntax</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I know some syntax now</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Gave me a basic understanding of syntax to fulfill my basic major education.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I know about syntax in a non-generative way.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It really made me think about grammar in a way i never considered. Like, if you read the sentence "John stabbed Mike the knife" clearly it doesn't make sense, but it's hard to explain WHY it doesn't make sense-- and that's what this class teaches you to do. You might know transitive vs intransitive verbs, but have you ever thought about equi vs raising verbs? Why can you say "The cat seemed to be out of the bag" but not "The cat tried to be out of the bag?" ???
