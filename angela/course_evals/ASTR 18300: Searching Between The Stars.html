				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Tried to judge student interest and background levels of knowledge--maybe it was at the right level for some people but personally I found the lectures somewhat unengaging.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Really did a good job at getting assignments and helpful feedback with those assignments back very quickly.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Strengths- 
-He really knows his material (like, if you have any random question, he can probably answer it and tell you related resources.)
-Really enthusiastic about the class
-Puts a lot of effort into teaching what we want to know and helping his students
-Gives in depth feedback on essays

Weaknesses
-The course is catered to what students want to hear about and his own interests.  If you're looking for a super structure follow-the-book class, this isn't it.
-No grades yet.  Not sure how that all calculates in.  (On the other hand, he gives a lot of feedback.)
-Class can be really boring sometimes (like he might read directly off one slide that lists helpful resources for fifteen minutes.)
-Because the only graded assignments are midterm/final essays, only half the class shows
-Sometimes lectures require a lot of previous science knowledge.  Then again, he asks for our backgrounds to make sure it is appropriate.

I guess some of these were more class structure related`</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The professor answered questions. However, I don't think he realized that we had not had that much physics experience to understand most of what he was talking about. Moreover, even understanding the powerpoints was hard because understanding the math and graph is just difficult was a class at this level. Also it was clear that the teacher did not have a syllabus or general course direction. Just appeared seemed like he talked about whatever he wanted to every lecture.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He clearly knows a lot and is a leader in his field, but his lectures were not focused. He was not a very engaging speaker and the class had no syllabus. Most of the students in the class were not majoring in physics or anything related to it, so a lot of his lectures went over our head. </li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>

			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More organized lectures, maybe some background material in physics.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I just thought the material presented during lectures was way over my head so I would dumb it down quite a bit</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>If there was a midterm then people would show up/pay attention/take notes.  This would increase class participation/morale and what we learn.  

</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Everything should be changed. Of the sequence, this was the worst class I have taken. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Add a syllabus, make the lectures more structured.</li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">Is there any topic in this course that you wished you had had previous background in?</h3>

			<li>Many topics in astronomy</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No, he asks everyone for our backgrounds to make sure the material is appropriately presented.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Everything.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Maybe a bit more physics would have helped me better understand some of the concepts, but it really wasn't that important that you understand everything. </li>

			<li>Not very.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not at all.  Sometimes his questions were fairly difficult and everyone would just sit there silently when he asked them.  </li>

			<li>I (obviously) learned more astronomy, but I think I also got a lot of insight into technology/general science concepts that are pretty useful.

Also, if you have any interest in like...any area of science, you can write about it for your paper and he will teach you/refer you to a lot of cool stuff.  </li>
