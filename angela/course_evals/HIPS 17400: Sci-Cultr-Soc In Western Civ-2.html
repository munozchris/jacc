				<h2>Evaluation Comments</h2>
				
			
	
	

	
		
			
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>His weaknesses were that his lectures weren't structured at all. The Powerpoints were just pictures - so no organization there. I often felt that he was just stating facts about history, with no end goal. Strengths were that he was kind of funny?</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Dr. Johns is a great lecturer. He was clearly very knowledgeable about the content and very enthusiastic about the subject and he's just so happy and cheerful himself that while in class he seems to hold your attention and want to listen to what he's saying. I would say he has no weaknesses.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Adrian told compelling narratives of the history but it could get dry and some of the information seemed tangential to what I could use for argument's sake in a paper. At times a bit ambiguous what the important information was.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He was very knowledgeable and approachable. I would have preferred have some slides with more of an outline of his lecture so it was easier to follow.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He was great, but should have been available outside class more. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He taught every class like he was telling a story-- it was great.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The instructor immediately made it clear that he knew what he was talking about, as it seemed like he was at the forefront of his small yet growing field of study. He presented us with a fact-based, mostly inarguable account of the history of science, giving us a general summary of the period without introducing us to highly debated or more mysterious topics. I enjoyed this presentation of the class, as it allowed us to make our own judgements and arguments in the weekly assignments, introducing us to the thought process of the field. Yet at the same time, this made it feel like I was learning nothing but a summary in lecture, while actual critical thought and learning was only taking place during homework assignments. Still, I learned both fact-based, general knowledge about the history of science, and how I might begin to interpret its causes and repercussions, so I'd say for the most part the professor was successful. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>There was no discussion, just lecture. All anyone had to do in this class was read the assigned works.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Johns is incredibly knowledgeable; very clearly characterizes the intellectual or cultural character of a certain time period. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Great at storytelling, which is wonderful in a history class. He made the information fun to learn. Unfortunately, the structure of the class was an 80 minute lecture twice a week--no discussions at all. That wasn't a weakness of the professor's--it just made it hard to stay engaged all through the class when all there was to do was listen. 

Also, he gave the essay prompts out way too late! We would have the weekend to work on it, sometimes only two days, during a time when the T.As weren't holding office hours. It was nerve-racking every time.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>What a cool guy. For real tho. I really like him. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Dr. Johns is incredible. He's very intelligent and knowledgeable, not only about the period of history and topics that we covered, but about many other historical and philosophical areas besides. His lectures are fascinating and often hilarious, though he has the tendency to become sidetracked from the goals of the lecture, and often spent more time talking about other topics that interested him, topics somewhat related to the focus of the particular lecture, than about the focus itself. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Johns is an absolutely fantastic orator. He managed to make the driest of subjects palatably amusing, and heaven knows the subject matter could use some spicing up. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lectures were very entertaining and I enjoyed them thoroughly. Unfortunately Professor Johns had a broken arm this quarter which made some classes more difficult. Other than that I enjoyed them.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Weakness- Did not consistently update slide material onto Chalk website, also, slides were always just pictures and diagrams w/ no words or captions- makes it difficult to know what's going on in the slide when you come back later to reference it for homework or a paper</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I thought they were all very helpful in providing feedback. But since they all took turns grading, I often felt it was a bit inconsistent - I would do significantly better with certain TA's grading, when trying to take into account all of their comments.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The TAs would be helpful with assignments, however, each TA seemed to want something different for the papers, and the TA who graded your paper was random, so even if you wrote something you thought was good for a previous TA, it would probably be graded harsher if your paper was graded by another one.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They could be harsh and the grading between the TAs didnt seem consistent. I couldn't tell what each TA wanted and what they were grading us for each week. It seemed arbitrary. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Sam Schulte was very very nice and helpful, gave good feedback on writing and also very helpful for planning writing, very willing to talk through papers, ideas, outlines etc</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>San was really helpful with papers and made the assignments much more manageable and easy.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Marshal Kramer was the best TA I have had at this school. He provided extensive feedback on my writing which was crucial in my development as a writer. His feedback was very insightful and he was able to imbue his own passion into his students'. He was prompt on email, very friendly and an excellent historian. I strongly recommend him to any and all students -- he deserves a Quantrell Teaching Award.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Marshall was very helpful in helping me narrow my general interest in a topic to a thesis statement for the final paper.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I hardly interacted with the TA's (my own fault for not going to office hours), yet their comments on papers and short essays were decently helpful and informative. They didn't always make it clear how I could improve my writing, and they hardly ever commented on what I did right, but they effectively and briefly identified where I went wrong, which was definitely helpful. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The teaching assistants graded in seemingly arbitrary ways</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Teaching assistants, particularly Marshall Kramer, gave constructive feedback on assignments and were very accessible.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They were a lot of help outside of class--they made themselves available and gave feedback if you needed it. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The TA's were generally very quick and always honest with feedback about assignments, and more than willing to meet with us to talk about the essays or about the course in general. However, they did not say what they expected from us on the assignments outside of office hours, and the assignments seemed to be graded somewhat arbitrarily. Even with major improvements, we could still get the same grade from assignment to assignment. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Marshall was incredible. Can't say a single bad thing about him.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I did not think that the TA's had a consistent grading style. I felt like I would fix my writing in order to please them, but they would take a cyclical approach to my writing and give it the same grade every time. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Weakness- Graded rather harshly</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would have him actually structure the course - use a powerpoint, say why the facts that he states matter and how that actually contributes to the goals of the course.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would change the fact that you have to write a paper every week because even if it's only 1 page, the TAs still ask for you to write about a lot more than what can fit in a one page paper. Also, having a clear rubric provided to the TAs would be great because then we wouldn't have to guess what the TAs wanted, since they all seem to want you to write in the style they prefer, but if the TAs are randomly switching who's paper to grade, then that's very difficult. One other thing I would change is to reduce the amount of pages the final paper is because 12-15 pages with primary sources from the 15th-17th centuries will require a great deal of time to write, and this is a core class. It would make sense if this was a major class, but for a core class, this is a bit too much.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would have liked to have some debates or discussions in class that mirrored the short essay topics, as those would have allowed me to get a sense of what my peers thought about the issues that we were discussing. I felt a little isolated in this class, absorbing knowledge in lecture and presenting my own ideas in homework with hardly any interaction with others' ideas. It may have been my own fault for not seeking out discussion of class topics, but I would have enjoyed not having to. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would add a class discussion.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Please give out the prompts for the essays, especially the midterm, much earlier. We got our midterm prompt on Thursday, it was due on Tuesday, and I wasn't able to attend the only TA office hours on Monday because of another class. Maybe others can write a seven page essay in five days on the first draft but I felt rushed and the paper was low in quality.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Please make the final essay shorter! Some of us are bad at writing and a 12-15 page essay is a lot for a core class. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The expectations for each essay should have been advertised more clearly, and maybe a session should have been held on how to write academic papers of the kind the TA's expected. Though Dr. Johns's tangents were interesting, he probably should have kept more closely to the lesson plan he showed at the beginning of each class and spent less time on the first few sections of the lecture. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing really.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Is there any topic in this course that you wished you had had previous background in?</h3>
				<div>

			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not especially. This class presented us with what knowledge was like before the scientific revolution and how it was transformed by the revolution itself. We haven't really talked about how the scientific revolution lead to modern scientific thought, but that might be addressed in a later course. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No, the readings and lectures were helpful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Isaac Newton. We spent very little time on Newton, although he was held to be one of the most important figures in the course. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The scientific revolution.
</li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">Which texts were most useful?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Shapin and Dear</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I found the primary readings to be useful because then you could always use them for your papers and they would be primary sources, always a good idea to include. Also, the required texts were somewhat helpful in summarizing and giving a clear picture of the time period.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The Dear and Shapin overviews</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Dear</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Revolutionizing the Sciences was very helpful overview of the topics discussed in the course.</li>

Dear - Revolutionizing the Sciences</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Peter Dear's book was very useful, and presented a great summary not only of the actual events of the revolution, but the thoughts and ideas behind it. Dear's book gave us a look at what actual history of science writings might look like, and it was very nice to have a kind of "staple" we might rely on for knowledge like this. </li>

Very concise, readable, accurate intellectual history, a kind of summary that the assigned primary sources are meant to supplement or serve as evidence for. </li>

			<li>Peter Dear's Revolutionizing the Sciences. Though much maligned by Professor Johns, the book was very useful as a clear secondhand source and a good introduction to the topics in most of the lectures. </li>

Without the homework assignments, this class would have given me a good knowledge of the general events of the scientific revolution, which is quite an accomplishment for less than 3 hours a week of classtime. </li>

			<li>I understand the development of science in the scientific revolution more thoroughly and the creation of the institution of the 'fact'. It was an interesting course, just not always clear in what way.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I am now able to reflect on the development of science critically -- it has inspired me to consider HIPS as a potential major. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It's given me a much-appreciated look at how science became what it is, and where the practices and beliefs of science come from. As a hopeful scientist myself, I find myself looking at my field of study a little differently, with a little less confidence that the scientific method is irrefutable and absolute. I appreciate this perspective, and I would recommend this course to anyone who might be interested in the sciences. Also, it was a very interesting and engaging choice of CIV for a student of the sciences, and I'm glad it was an option. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>We questioned whether the "Scientific Revolution" was either scientific or revolutionary, uprooting a conventional idea. We learned that history of science involves viewing historical knowledge through its contemporary context, not through today's. We were also exposed to some cool primary sources.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Helpful for setting the stage of how science development and discovery kind of began. Looking back, it was great to see the intersections of religion, personal beliefs, and science. Also, it taught me how to write like a historians--no opinions, only arguments. It was good.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The course gives a very good, very interesting introduction to the period called 'The Scientific Revolution'. It touches on a lot of different topics and famous figures, but introduces dozens of new ones just as interesting as their more famous contemporaries. It's a good course for anyone interested in history, especially the history of science, who is willing to put in the work to keep up with the class. </li>
