				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Although Seth can appear chauvinistic at times, it's well-warranted. He's truly knowledgeable and has a tangible, deep passion for music. I only wish our class responded in like enthusiasm, as he's a professor whose skill and mastery deserves the very best.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>In class, Seth was highly engaging, enjoyable, and fun despite the low participation. People did warm up to participation as the class went on, which is a good indicator of a strong Professor. Despite that, there were instances of passive-aggressiveness in class and over email that were a little annoying. However, I felt that I needed to try harder after these instances, so I guess it worked.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Seth was pretty great. He has an incredibly wide range of knowledge on topics both musical and extramusical, asks probing questions and his lectures were quite fascinating. He was a little fickle in providing feedback with assignments and didn't give us information on our paper prompt until toward the end of the course (when the syllabus said the prompt would be available starting 2nd week); that being said, I don't particularly blame him because he'd also been preoccupied with submitting tenure materials and the like during this quarter. Outside of that, the course could perhaps have been organized better and expectations could have been more clearly delineated.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>-Very Interesting and very knowledgable in the subject</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very interesting to listen to, knows a lot about the topics and can answer almost any question. Nice person and very fair. Sometimes it is hard to determine whether what he says is important and should be noted. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Seth made this course very interesting and enjoyable. We did everything from singing in the chapel, dancing to Rite of Spring to discussing popular music. His views on music being grounded in social context is incredibly interesting and is an important insight to everyday life. However, the way he starts the discussions can be awkward as they are normally extremely open-ended and no one dares to express 'what they think'. The course also started very slowly in the beginning with many things not set in stone.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Unreasonable expectations for students, but knowledgeable and easy to get along with</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Seth is awesome. He has the most organized syllabus and lecture I have ever seen and I sent it to my dad (another professor) who proceeded to gawk over the formality of the course. The class itself is a perfect difficulty level and Seth/Lindsay really work hard to keep it an active discussion-based forum.  </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Brodsky was a very good instructor overall. He was extremely knowledgeable about the topics we discussed, and prepared his classes well (his lecture slides were extremely impressive). The only weakness perhaps is that he sometimes assumed we understood concepts we only briefly discussed in previous weeks.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lindsay was enthusiastic, positive, and passionate about the material.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lindsey was pretty cool I guess.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lindsay was really sweet and had a wealth of knowledge both on music and society, and she really added another dimension to the course. She was also extremely helpful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Always gave insightful comments in class and did a good job engaging everybody and facilitating discussion when she led the class on Bach. She had some fun activities like having us raise our hands when we heard certain things in the music. Very approachable and helpful with assignments. There were times when she became slightly disorganized (for example toward the end of class) but it did not take away from the overall learning experience. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lindsay is very friendly and led discussions very well! She prepares her material well beforehand so knows how to lead the discussion. For example, she knows what each person will likely talk about so encourages those who don't speak so much. Her thesis is also incredibly interesting and very relevant to our everyday life.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Really nice, really helpful</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lindsay seems like a genuinely happy and enthused person that loves both the course material and in-class participation. Very relatable. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lindsay always had something interesting to say during class. I thought the two classes she led were some of the best. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing - Seth structured it very well.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Perhaps the organization, but that's pretty much it.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The readings were very heavy some weeks, maybe scale down a bit. There were times where I skipped everything that wasn't designated "read closely". </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Spend slightly less time with earlier music and move to more interesting and socially relevant music</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I think having the paper due in the middle of the course (with a rigid date and prompt given out with a couple weeks notice) would be better than having the paper and final on the exact same day. Other than that, the class was great and I would DEFINITELY recommend taking it. Bummed I can't take Seth's Spring course on Music and the Melancholy :( </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Is there any topic in this course that you wished you had had previous background in?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Classical music in general</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nope</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>None</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Which texts were most useful?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>All of the supplementary readings</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They were all interesting, honestly.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I particularly enjoyed Williams, Forster and McClary. They were all good. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Taruskin, McClary, Clark</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>none</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Weekly readings per musical composition. Not really textbook-based class. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Which least?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They all served a purpose</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>A couple of the readings not directly related to music (e.g., the TJ Clark), while extremely engaging and connectable to the works on the syllabus, could have been excised given the amount of reading (often of dense essays) expected of us.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The Taruskin piece on Stravinsky was rather brutal to try to decipher.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Taruskin's piece on the Rite was slightly too hard to understand in my opinion.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>pretty much all of them. They were boring and completely forgettable as soon as you read the sentence. Sometimes I had no idea what the reading was and class never helped me figure that out. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>n/a, do the readings.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">How productive was class discussion?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Seth had to push us to get discussion going at times, but this was no fault of his - our core class was understandably shy.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>As the course progressed, class discussion got better. It appeared to me that everyone, including myself, paid very little attention to the readings at first, but later started to delve deeper into them.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Somewhat productive; it was occasionally difficult to get done all the readings Seth expected us to have finished and sometimes his lectures partially supplanted discussion time, but when discussions *were* started up and sustained they were very lively and illuminating.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Discussion was dry during the first few weeks and got much better afterward. By the end of the quarter, they were quite productive. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very producting</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Discussion was pretty dead, but even when it was alive I never felt like I uncovered more about the readings/listenings for that week. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Class discussion was productive most of the time, though there were moments in which Seth was really the only one talking and it was apparent that people hadn't prepared sufficiently for lecture. Definitely do the readings. They aren't very long and are super helpful for in class discussion.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It varied. Sometimes discussion was very lively, while others it was non-existent. </li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">How has this course contributed to your education?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I have a deeper analytical understanding of music and of its history, and therefore a deeper appreciation of it. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I've become more astute in listening to *all* types of music more actively.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Exposed me to analytical thinking in the Arts, and how to listen to music in an objective and inquiring manner.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Taught me various new insights to the world and how to think. Encouraged me to pursue music even further</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Convinced me to do the music minor. </li>
