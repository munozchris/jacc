				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Raikhel understood that not all of us had an anthropology background (I didn't) and made sure to give us adequate background.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>smart, nice</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>THE BEST COURSE I'VE TAKEN AT UCHICAGO. I want to take it again. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He was late to class every single day, which was very frustrating. He is not a very dynamic lecturer and seemed to have trouble holding the attention of the class. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He presented very interesting lecture materials, but sometimes read a little bit too much from quotes and texts.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He was very clear and organized.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Clearly smart and interesting, but maybe presented too broad an overview of the topic at the expense of depth... I feel like we covered just a little bit of everything, so much more introductory than I expected, especially given the fact that most people are in this class due to prior experience</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Raikhel is incredibly knowledgable and kind.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Raikhel gives wonderful lectures that really compliment what we've read for that day in a way that rewards you if you've done the readings by really adding to (rather than repeating) the main points of each reading assignment. He encourages class participation during lecture from the beginning which makes it possible to ask any question or contribute any though you've had during his lecture.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Raikhel presented clear, articulate lectures and answered students' questions well. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Well organized, attentive, good at varying class content (presentations, videos, short discussions), but too versed in a limited area of medical anthropological study.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He is pleasant and not intimidating which made people ask questions more frequently. I also appreciated that he used video clips throughout the lectures so they weren't solely speech.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Raikhel structured every class very well; the lectures always aligned with the readings but provided new and important insights. He also provided a comprehensive picture of all topics covered, which made lectures enjoyable and informative.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Raikhel was articulate and presented wonderful lectures that were engaging, clear, and integrated media (video, photographs, even radio segments) impeccably, which is a lot to say about powerpoints! Class was an absolute delight </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Raikhel was available outside of class and even provided additional discussion sections that he led, which we could attend but were not required to do so.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Raikhel is an excellent instructor. He gauges the class well, presenting us with interesting information while tying in the readings. I appreciate how the readings were very relevant to in-class lectures/discussions without simply being rehashed. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I really enjoyed the power points, the additional materials the professor brought in were always really interesting. The visuals held my attention. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Raikhel was definitely very knowledgeable about the topic. His lectures were interesting and discussion was pretty productive when he facilitated it. I guess, the only bad thing is that the class was a big lecture with two TAs so I never even got a chance to talk to him...</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Sometimes I would get confused in the lectures as to what we were discussing in relation to the readings, but the lectures were always interesting, regardless. </li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kate was amazing!</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>she was great! very smart, helpful and nice</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>KATE WAS AWESOME! SHE MADE DISCUSSION SO GREAT AND MEANINGFUL AND PRODUCTIVE</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>She facilitated excellent class discussion and brought up really great questions and topics for discussion. She encouraged everyone to participate and openly think about certain issues.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kate was an extremely good moderator for discussion, she kept it interesting and responded well to questions.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali is brilliant but often used discussion to talk about what interested her and did not put enough emphasis on letting us to bring up our own topics.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali was such a wonderful TA! She did a great job of structuring our discussion sections and making them as productive as possible even though we had such limited time to cover each reading. She let everyone express their own ideas, but also played devil's advocate in a way that really pushed discussion to be really thoughtful and productive rather than just everyone going around talking about how the reading made them feel.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali was very knowledgeable and articulate. I really appreciated how she clearly laid out important points to take from the readings and concisely summarized students comments. I also appreciated how she set aside time to talk with us about the final. However, she wasn't very helpful in encouraging discussion. She didn't encourage students to speak to each other, rather most of the session was devoted to her asking questions and responding to answers. It was like we were having a directed conversation with her rather than a collaborative discussion with our peers. So I think people got a bit frustrated and didn't contribute as much as they would have.  </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Informative, interested in the material, approachable.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali was nice, but our section was just boring. I don't blame her but no one really wanted to talk and it was always awkward. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kathryn is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. She knew the right questions to ask to get the class interested and involved in discussion. She also made herself available outside of class whenever necessary.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali is great! Fantastic at moderating discussion, providing insightful commentary and gently directing discussion, seemingly effortlessly, in a productive direction. She made discussion sections productive and useful for the class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali Feser was approachable, funny, and so so smart.  She led one of the best discussion sections I've had in my 4 fours, because she continually motivated new thinking and got everyone to participate.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kate is an excellent TA. She is very helpful with writing papers, answering questions and providing suggestions for research paths. She also led discussion very well, facilitating without seeming controlling or forced. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kate was absolutely fantastic. She was engaging during discussion sections and very knowledgable about the topics being discussed. Very helpful during office hours and email correspondences.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ali was super nice and obviously very passionate and excited about us talking about these ideas in the discussion sections and in office hours. While the discussion sections were productive, I thought they were a little unorganized.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I can't say enough good things about Kate. She was brilliantly smart, clear in her teaching, enthusiastic, and very helpful. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>none</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>NOTHING PLEASE</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would probably assign slightly less reading.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>There should be more discussion sections and less movie clips.  If we're going to have lecture slides, maybe every other class have a discussion rather that one every four classes.  By the time we discussed a topic, there was no time to go over everything we'd covered, so we were constantly a week behind and had moved past the topic.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would have less readings so we could focus on the most important ones.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More discussion sections! We barely had time to talk about everything! The discussion sections were still very useful and productive because our TA would structure them nicely, but it would have been nice to somehow have more time. Prof. Raikhel and the TA's responded to such requests during the quarter by offering additional and optional discussion sections, which I was very thankful for! However, unfortunately due to scheduling conflicts I was never able to attend any of those additional sections. So if the only way to have additional discussion sections is to make some extra ones optional, I suggest to have those scheduled ahead of time in the beginning of the quarter so that students can plan to attend in advance.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The option to miss one discussion question would have been very helpful. I would have preferred to just opt out of one week where I really didn't have the time to devote to a decent question instead of making my TA read some scribbles. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More theoretical context to the development of modern medical anthropology.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Probably 1 reading response every 2 weeks. Having to do one every week increases the chance that people will BS what they write just to get credit for something.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Some of the readings were a bit on the long side, which made the assignments for some weeks difficult to complete. Nevertheless, the readings were all useful, but they could maybe be condensed a bit for manageability. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Shorter chalk posts, 500 is a bit much. Maybe 300 to 500 words? Or maybe add a weekly discussion section, really enjoyed the discussion section segments of the course (which met every other week)</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More discussion time.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I liked that the class was a lecture and then once in a while we had smaller discussion sections with our TA, but it made the professor seem inaccessible at times...</li>
