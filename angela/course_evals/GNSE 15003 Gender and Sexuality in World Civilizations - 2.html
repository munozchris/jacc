				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kristen is maybe the best professor I've had here so far. She is so approachable and friendly and helpful before, during, and after class, and she made sure to build a personal relationship with the class. She's brilliant in her field and in all the topics we studied. I always felt comfortable sharing in class and learned a lot from Kristen's worldview. I'm not normally a fan of group work, but the small group discussions we had in class were actually quite helpful. I can't think of any weaknesses. Take a class from her!</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I love Kristen. She's an amazing professor who really cares about her students. She made the class feel comfortable discussing difficult topics, and really broadened my view of how gender blows over into everything. Sometimes she'll say something that blows your mind. Can't say enough good things about this class, or the instructor.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Great discussion leader.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No weaknesses. Kristen Schilt is a wonderful human being. She is incredibly smart and says things that are just casually brilliant off the cuff. She's also excellent at facilitating discussion. I've had problems in the past with participating in class, but I felt incredibly comfortable participating in Professor Schilt's class. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kristen is one of my favorite professors I've ever had. She was enthusiastic and presented the information in an interesting way that always kept the discussion going.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>She was very approachable and had interesting perspectives on a lot of the material. She was really easy to talk to and that made class discussion very fruitful. No weaknesses I can think of. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kristen is warm, funny, engaging, and so smart. She kept me engaged and presented material very clearly. no weaknesses.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>strengths: so wonderful in most ways!!  very clear, engaging, forgiving, challenging, and kind. 

weaknesses: allowed a tiny bit of basic, harmful rhetoric into the classroom.  maybe I'm just bitter.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kristen did a great job encouraging us to think about real-world applications for the thoery we were reading. Sometimes it was hard to get discussion going. Overall she was wonderful!!!!</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie is also super brilliant and helpful and wonderful! She did a great job of leading class discussion a few times.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie was proficient at directing discussion. She seemed nervous at times but brought up some brilliant points at important parts of the class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie was the best. Super helpful, always available to meet.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie was nice and very helpful. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie was really nice and had a lot of helpful feedback. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>She lead class very effectively and gave great comments on work. No weaknesses I can think of. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie provided helpful, grounding examples for the theory we read. no weaknesses. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>katie is a sweetheart!  she did a great job teaching when she got the chance, and her contributions to kristen's classes were always clear and helpful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Katie was great! Very helpful. Sometimes it was hard to figure out how to use her advice without going to office hours or meeting one-on-one.</li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>

			<li>Nothing this quarter, it was amazing</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Make it longer. One of the worst things about the quarter system is having less time in the classes that you like. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>There was a lot of reading even when assignments were due. It made it hard to keep up at times.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>For some of the longer readings, especially the Handmaid's Tale, we needed more time to not only read it, but also discuss it. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would assign slightly fewer readings so we could go more into depth on the ones we read. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>more readings that center trans girls !  and a clear prioritization of woc and trans women OVER cis white women in discourse.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">Is there any topic in this course that you wished you had had previous background in?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nope</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>More intersectional readings.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>No. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The professor and some students threw around a lot of sociology terms that I was unfamiliar with (such as kinship ties) that would have been helpful to know beforehand. </li>

				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Kristen is an excellent facilitator, and the class had a great dynamic. No one voice ever seemed to dominate the conversation, and I feel like I learned a lot from the discussions we had.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Class discussion was lit.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Extremely. Great class discussion. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very productive. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Discussions were very productive and interesting. We did a lot of group work which facilitated more people's ideas being heard.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>There were some people that seemed to dominate discussion, but on the whole it was very productive and were very interesting. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Often it started out slow, but once it got started we often had fruitful discussion. Discussions were most lively when relating gender theory to the University. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I found that many of the students who ended up in this class were preoccupied with basic, uncritical, reductive, and ultimately harmful angles on gender and sexuality -Â&nbsp;namely (especially), the plight of the cis woman in her modern struggle against the cis man.  I zoned out more than I would have liked when discussion took this turn.  Kristen was decent at diverting discussion to more productive areas!  but I think her good nature and desire to take all students seriously made this more difficult.  I don't blame her, I think it was just by virtue of its being a core class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Usually ok. Better when we split into groups.</li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">How has this course contributed to your education?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>This class has given me a much more nuanced understanding of the history of gender and sexuality issues in the United States and around the world and different activist tactics.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Gender Civ 2 has been my favorite course so far. I felt I was able to really engage with the texts and discuss them on a much deeper level in class. Super fun. 10/10 would recommend</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I learned how to look at the world differently. I recommend all students to take this course.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I've learned how to talk about gender and sexuality in complex and fascinating ways beyond just rhetoric. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I feel more comfortable speaking in class, I feel more confident articulating my arguments in writing, and I have a greater understanding of the pitfalls that many modern-day liberal feminists fall into </li>
