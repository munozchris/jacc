				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Great at getting discussions going. GREAT comments on essays she hands back. Took long to give essays back but did so before the next essay prompts were given out.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Omie was a very engaging discussion facilitator, and maintain a good balance between having more free-form discussions and clarifying concepts from the text. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Tended to go off on tangents, but they were helpful tangents and added to my writing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Omie was very good at directing the lectures and extremely clear. She did a really good job responding to any of our questions. Additionally, she was really helpful outside of class, providing insights into material that we may not have been able to cover during class. She was pretty genuinely invested in how we were doing. For example, she would adjust the reading schedule to ease our burden during weekdays and was generally very considerate of us. I was also a really big fan of the Chalk discussion board.
I would've preferred to get papers back before 10th week and also to get the writing prompts earlier. Was also a little disappointed that we cut out chapters of Marx in order to discuss in greater depth Chapter 1. Chapter 1 is pretty important but I feel like we could've spent 1.5  classes on it at most to start and then returned to it at the very end of Marx because it probably would've been more clear. I feel like there were a lot of interesting things in Capital that we missed out on.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Omie was very energetic throughout every class and greatly made me want to continue taking her class. The only weakness was that it took a very long time to get our midterm papers returned. This was acceptable because of extensive comments provided.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Enjoyed teaching and led helpful discussions. Really enjoyed the comments on my graded paper. Sometimes, her teaching was disorganized, but nothing major and was often an attempt to adapt to what the class did not understand. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Spent too much time at the beginning of classes going over logistics. Otherwise an excellent teacher, very helpful commentary on essays, good at facilitating discussion, definitely knew the texts extremely well and was willing to talk to the students about them outside of class. Also good at taking the classes thoughts into account.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Omi is extremely enthusiastic and clearly cares about the class and the students. She made very good comments on our midterm papers, altough it did take her more than a month to grade them. Some class sessions were disorganized, with a lot of time wasted at the beginning, sometimes 30 minutes or more. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Omie is a very good instructor. She knows a lot about the topic and is able to facilitate very good conversations. However, sometimes discussions digress from the main topic.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The pedagogical style used in and out of class encouraged independent thought and a student-led environment. The instructor had a deep and nuanced understanding of the material. However, organization of class time and time management could have been far improved.</li>

				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Less readings from Marx.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>A lot of the hw and questions in the exam are just too time-consuming than being useful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Probably just the reading schedule. I would've preferred to cover as much of Marx as possible and then maybe have the very last class be a recap of the major themes in it. Also, wasn't really a fan of the Gift, would much rather have preferred to do more Marx than 2 days of Mauss.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not a thing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Sometimes the readings were badly timed. More a fault of the department/course supervisor than the instructor</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Would have appreciated longer readings/getting through more of the texts. Also would have liked more required writing, I get noticeably out of practice. </li>

			<li>No.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I wish I knew more about the historical context of the readings, so that I could better understand the authors' political agenda and philosophical perspective. </li>

			<li>Not really.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>None - seemed to be a pretty basic intro class</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>A background on the economies of the authors time would be nice. </li>

			<li>All were great.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>All of them.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Capital and The Gift were good.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>All</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Marx's Capital.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I really enjoyed Marx and Rousseau's writing, even if their ideas didn't truly resonate with me as often. Mauss's content was great, despite his writing which assumed the reader was familiar with terms specific to the his topic. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Marx, Smith</li>

			<li>Marx</li>

				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Wealth of Nations was boring; Rousseau was confusing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Mauss was still interesting, to an extent.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I personally disliked Smith the most.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Smith. I despise Smith</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Mauss</li>

			<li>Productive. People were very engaged.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>They were engaging, but not particularly productive, because we often spent a lot of time covering a fraction of the reading for the class. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very productive generally, except when one student went on a 5 minute rant about Teddy Roosevelt.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Pretty productive. A lot of different people contributed. Omie managed the discussion quite well.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Discussion was very productive.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Usually very productive, or as productive as a core class like this could be. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Good, the class was very engaged. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Once the discussion got going it was pretty productive, although with Marx especially the instructor had to clarify some concepts. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very productive.</li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">How has this course contributed to your education?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Introduced me to key texts in human thought.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Yes</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I feel like I've become better at close reading and am somewhat more confident in my analyses/my ability to write a paper. Was good to read some seminal texts, am glad that I took the class since I do feel like my horizons have been broadened/I've gained new perspectives from it. All in all, a welcome struggle.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I now have a more well rounded understanding of these powerful texts.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Mostly, its been a course in how to write better more than anything else. I knew most of the material beforehand</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>If the student is willing to engage with the texts they can really learn some different and interesting perspectives. Sure, Communism didn't work out as planned, but alot of the axioms Marx uses still make sense today, and can definitely change ones perspective. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Helped me understand the philosophy behind economic theory</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I like sociology. This course definitely provides me with the basic knowledge I need to explore more in the field of sociology</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Through this course, I have been introduced to an analytic mode of thought and a structure of the teacher-student relationship that has given me a sense of what a good crouse looks like.</li>
