				<h2>Evaluation Comments</h2>
				
			
	
	

	
		
			
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable professor. Occasionally he would break off in the middle of a sentence and mutter to himself, which could be a little perplexing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>VERY easily distracted, led off topic.  Sometimes spent inordinate amounts of time on minor details.  But when he stayed on topic he was quite good, and could be pretty amusing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not as organized as I had expected</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Disorganized.  It's very difficult to follow his lectures... it's almost as if he tries to make whatever he writes on the chalkboard difficult to follow.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Strengths - obviously a fantastic command of the material, and a clear enthusiasm to share it with his students. 
His notes were MUCH more helpful than Osborne. Seems to care about his students, and wants to convey the importance of concepts rather than just answers to questions. 

Weaknesses - spent too long in class going over homework problems, did not pace the course well - there were some lectures which were slow and in which one learnt nothing new, other lectures in which he speeded through key concepts. Particularly the final lectures on Bayesian Games and Extensive Imperfect Information Games were not thorougly taught. Needs to organize the lectures better. His notes on the board are all over the place! </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Strengths: Obviously very knowledgable. Also, genuinely cares about the students learning the material.
Weaknesses: Lectures are sometimes unclear and confusing. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Myerson definitely knows the material very well and provides the students with notes and references for examples. However, he doesn't finish many sentences and sometimes revises his statements, making it difficult to ascertain what he wants and when.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>strengths - He definitely knows his stuff; repeats things to make them clear, goes through examples for each concept
weakness- sometimes doesn't finish his sentences but its a stylistic point</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very smart and patient.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>If you are thinking about taking a class from Myerson just because of his Nobel status, you will be pleasantly surprised with his talent and dedication to teaching.  He really focuses on what's important, getting the material and its essential concepts across to students so that they actually understand it, and really has a distaste for grades, shortcuts or other ways of regurgitating material without actually understanding it.  In this respect he is one of the best instructors I've had at this university.  He is also very good at explaining difficult concepts to student with no previous knowledge in the subject.  At times in lecture, he could get a bit hung up on finishing his example problems and other tangents, but otherwise amazing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Goes through everything in a very step by step thought process, which is helpful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The teaching assistant was too arrogant, unhelpful, and refused to answer most questions replying that "[he] can't be bothered with this."</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He used to have a very negative attitude when being asked questions.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ryan Fang is the worst TA I've had at the University of Chicago.  He was actually mean.  After a conversation with him, I almost cried.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Feedback on homework was non-existent.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>N/A</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Na</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ryan wasn't good.  In discussion section, he just went over what was written in class and problems from the last p-set.  He was very poor at explaining anything if you did not understand, and he tried his best to make you feel like an idiot.  He also was in charge of grading out problem sets, but he only marked them with checks and minuses with no explanation of how something was wrong so that we could improve.  He really couldn't have cared less.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The second half of the class was much faster and more difficult than the first.. a little more balance would be good.  Also, more examples/practice problems would be useful.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The T.A, he was of no help in any way.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The professor.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Do not use Osborne - the book is not at the right level for the course - it is too descriptive. Myerson should improve his own notes and use them as the textbook for the course</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I would change the textbook- it is hard to understand and doesn't give enough examples to actually solve problems.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Nothing.</li>

			<li>Myerson's notes were more useful than the book (Osborne), but it was good to have two different explanations for the material</li>
