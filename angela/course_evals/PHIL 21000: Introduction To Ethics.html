				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the instructor's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Its a Callard class, so you expect little and get less. I'm not sure what part of class is worse, his 'lectures' or having to listen to all of the bleeding hearts in the class argue with feelings and not facts. But, if there is to be something admirable about class was its consistency, for each session never failed to subtract from the sum of human knowledge. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ben was really good at directing discussion despite the size of the class, and was really good at directing conversations that were not just speaking to him, instead of other students. However, since it was a large class, there was still a good amount of lecture, which he presented in an interesting but informative way. Sometimes he could dwell too long on specific subjects, but he was always clear about when he would  go over specific parts of the material. He was so funny and awesome, such a great teacher, and was really enthusiastic about the material and the things his students had to say!!</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The question of whether I would want to take another class from Ben is a tricky one. On one hand, I would leave class lamenting that the aggregate level of wisdom of the human race had seemingly been detracted from in a meaningful way in the preceding hour and twenty minutes. On the other, Ben structured the course in such a way that did not require attendance at lecture, and thus my exposure to such radical and illuminating ideas as the ambiguity of vegetable capacity for pain was minimized. That said, Ben is a genuinely nice guy.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Callard is an impressive teacher.  Despite the fact that the students in this class were the dumbest bunch I've seen in my years at this school, Professor Callard was able to weave our comments into a coherent narrative.  He was able to find serious philosophical positions in what sounded to me like students' aimless rambling and show the upsides and downsides of that view. I came out of every class with not just new knowledge but a newfound curiosity. Only weakness is that he could have been more demanding.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ben is great! His lectures are really illuminating and he always has good responses to student questions/comments</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Callard explained concepts well and generally seemed like an nice guy.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ben is great!! He's so so nice and really loves philosophy. He always has a smile during lecture and gets excited when we get something right or contribute. Made me want to participate a lot more</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Dr. Callard is excellent. He is an engaging lecturer and a brilliant thinker. He listens thoughtfully to student input and debates with students (always kindly) to challenge our thinking.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Lively person and good lecturer.  He tried to get a lot of class participation and that was good, but having participation be so much of your grade at the end makes no sense when the class is over 50 people.  </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ben is amazing. He is absolutely brilliant and he loves teaching, and it really shows during class. He is a joy to learn from. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Callard is wonderful. So knowledgable in the field of ethics. He clearly enjoys the act of teaching and engaging students. He is liberal with his acknowledgment of potential flaws in his own theories and invites students to consider that different paths. I have never had a professor like him who has convinced me that he is genuinely pursuing the same path of inquiry (if heading in different directions) as me--although he is quite the expert, he is humble in his role as an eternal learner. Finally, he is wonderful about responding to emails/providing students with additional resources to explore areas of curiosity.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Callard was exceptional, he assigns managable reading and gets us to think about things in new ways, he hopes to learn from us as we learn from him and he is able to do this in a big 60 person class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Extremely intelligent, responded to questions well, explained points well, very kind and understanding</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ben is so enthusiastic about the material, it's hard not to love this class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>HE was good at philosophy, none really. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Great at explaining the concepts of the class &amp; responding to students' questions. But sometimes when the material or discussion gets too abstract, or when we linger on one student's questions/comments for too long, he loses me.</li>

				<h3 class="eval-title">What were the teaching assistant's or writing intern's strengths? Weaknesses?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Skomantas was a boss. Charismatic, knowledgeable, good at leading discussion, fair grader.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Skomantas did a great job leading discussions. Kept conversation flowing and on relevant topics. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Skomantas was a great TA. He was a little permissive during section Because of his comments, I continued to think about the issues I had written about after getting a grade. I also appreciate that he went through my papers multiple times (as I could see from the timestamps).</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>John was really knowledgeable about ethics and did a good job presenting ideas that were not covered already by Professor Callard's lectures. For a discussion session, there wasn't much discussion, but I found it really helpful anyway.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>John was very knowledgeable about the course material and wrote thoughtful</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>My TA Skomantas was great. He was so nice and helpful, always willing to meet or answer questions and was very understanding. He led great discussions too</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Skomantus is a great guy and a good discussion leader.  The essay grades/feed back are a bit of a crap-shoot.  If there's a particular approach they want you to take in evaluating an argument they should tell you in advance.  </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>John was really insightful and fun in discussion section.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>John was well-organized and prepared for discussion section, which was really nice. However, he was impossible to meet with outside to ask paper questions. He also didn't respond to emails. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>John was wonderful. He did a gret job clarifying material and was very helpful and willing to meet outside of class. He cared about us and made sure to go the extra mile. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Skomantas was very helpful and a fair grader</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>John was so available to help or give paper feedback, and really helped me articulate my thoughts and confusion about the thinkers we read.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He graded too hard</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Skomantas was great at leading discussion sessions &amp; grading papers w/useful feedback.</li>

			<li>Skomantas did a much better job leading discussion than the lecturer. Was able to curb the BS and make sure we got something out of the readings.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>For such a large class, discussion was really productive. Since the papers were so evaluative in nature, the questions that people asked were good to start thinkinga bout the issues that we could write about in our papers.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>In class, terrible; in discussion section, pretty good.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It was always extremely productive. Professor Callard was very good at taking students' inane comments seriously and uncovering nuance where I hadn't seen it. For example, a student might say "Like, morals can't be real bro, you know, kuz like if one guy thinks abortion is wrong and someone else thinks it's right, who's to say bro?" And then Professor Callard would show how the "who's to say bro" argument actually presupposes that morals are real. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very productive. It's a philosophy class, discussion is what it is all about</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Productive, but the large class made direct discussion more difficult</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It was fine from a 56 person class.  </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very productive, helped explained readings well.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Callard is so nice that he lets people ramble on about their points for a bit too long. Sometimes these points were just wrong...</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Ben was great at discussion and genuinely cared about students and what they said</li>

			<li>Class discussion was productive particularly when going over the important concepts/terms, but it would be easy to get lost when keeping the conversation on one student's comments too long.</li>

			<li>It's made me better at evaluating argumentation and situational ethical issues, and be more discerning about how to craft and critique discussion. Although ethics are a little hypothetical, the focus on the arguments has really helped me think more critically about the positions I take in my real life and in other classes.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>This course made me curious about many issues I hadn't really thought about and gave me a sense of the lay of the land in terms of what people have thought about them.</li>
