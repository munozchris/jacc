			<li>Tenorio knows a LOT about Latin American history, however he cannot convey any of that knowledge to the class. His lectures were just stories tangentially related to the readings and the slides he projected during the lectures. The lectures were extremely hard to follow because he would ramble on about unrelated things. Sometimes he tries to relate it to something in, say, American history but he just gets mad when nobody knows what happened in a completely different country on a specific date, to which he just yells "This isn't Latin American history! This is YOUR history, you all know this!" I have almost no notes for this class because I have no idea what I'm supposed to take notes on. Literally all I have is a single page that says "Brazil is so big."

Tenorio assigned FAR too much reading. Every week I waited until the TA emailed us what we were going to discuss on Friday and then just read those 10 pages (keep in mind tenorio assigns 60-140 pages weekly).

The syllabus for the class had his office hours but not the location of his office. He didn't have the TAs emails or names on the syllabus! He wouldn't respond to any of my emails.

I do not understand why people love this professor so much, he's probably the worst professor I've had so far at this school.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>The lectures didn't really have a clear structure and were hard to follow;</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I thought Professor Tenorio was a great lecturer--he was really good at giving us big pictures that put details of the readings in perspective. I liked that he used powerpoint slides as a guide for the lecture but didn't just read from them. His lecturing style might not be for everyone though. I found that the lectures were hard to follow if I had missed a class or not yet done the reading, especially since Tenorio makes a lot of connections between his lectures. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof. Tenorio was hilarious.  I have a long list of amazing quotes of things he said during lecture that cracked me up.  He is passionate about the subject and about its relevance to American history, politics, culture, etc.  However, he is the most disorganized person I have ever met.  He provided a syllabus which said things like Weeks 7-9: read blah.  When do I read things???  At the beginning of this period?  The end?  It didn't really matter because he didn't follow it anyway, which led to the TAs telling what 100-page chapter to read 24 hours before we were required to post a discussion post on it.  Obviously, I just totally stopped reading.  We also went through the 1920 when the class was supposed to stop in the 1820s.  Not sure why that happened.  The textbook the professor was lecturing from and 'assigning' reading from did not match the one for sale at the Sem Coop and no one realized this until 8th week.  It's the professor's job to make sure those match.  The exams were a joke, and were the level of difficulty I would expect in 6th grade, not a world-class university.  He would go on long rants about contemporary American politics, which, while amusing, were not the point of the class, and rarely clarified anything.  I want to learn Latin American history as its own thing, not in order to understand relations with the US exclusively.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Tenorio was a great storyteller and very interesting, but his lectures were so incredibly unorganized. It was hard to tell what we needed to get from lecture and what was important. He also continued to say that he can't teach all of the history in 10 weeks, which was discouraging in a way.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Very knowledgeable on the subject, and open to go deeper into the subject when asked privately. His lectures and overall plan for the class were not very organized though</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Tenorio has very interesting and insightful ideas about large historical concepts as they pertain to the construct of Latin America. His lecturing style can take some time to get used to, as he has a stick he likes to wave, and he can be a bit repetitive at times. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Mauricio seems to be very knowledgeable about the subject. On the other hand, his lectures seemed to not put emphasis on the relevant aspects of Latin American history in comparison to the readings and were only loosely related to the readings. He tries to give a different take on the subject, but it just made everything more confusing rather than giving helpful insight. This is not to say he is a bad professor, just that he could be better.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He was clearly very passionate about Latin American history, but a bit disorganized and unclear. Sometimes I had trouble paying attention.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Professor Tenorio did a great job of motivation and presenting the material in a way that was relevant to life in the contemporary United States. He did a good job of trying to ensure students were interested in lectures and the topic. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>I don't think Tenorio has any business teaching a Civ lecture. This was the second civ SEQUENCE I've taken (and my 5th quarter of civ) and never have lectures been so useless. I've never relied on class texts so much. And yet the syllabus was incredibly disorganized and unclear, and in person Tenorio never clarified what he wanted us to read each week. My lecture notes for a class have never been so useless. Professor Tenorio mumbled and trailed off and was impossible to follow. He was moody, cranky, disorganized, unclear, and taught me hardly anything. His lectures had no structure and I never knew what to take away from class. The few slides he did project on the board each day made absolutely no sense, either. He also always seemed to be in a terrible mood, and we were constantly behind because he failed to realize that he had to leave the country one weekend and couldn't teach class on a Monday, and he also didn't realize the school closes for MLK Day. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Prof Tenorio clearly knew what he was talking about, and is passionate about Latin American history. However, his lectures were often disorganized and difficult to understand.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Tenorio has a different perspective on the history of Latin America, which was interesting and refreshing. He could be really disorganized, which made it seem like some of the lectures were useless, but I liked his style nonetheless. </li>

					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Erin is super nice and a REALLY fair grader. I thought I was going to fail my midterm papers but I actually got over 90 on both of them. Bless Erin's heart.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Chris was enthusiastic and friendly, and made discussion a lot less painful than I thought it would be. I felt like his tendency to look through our chalk posts and ask people about them during discussion wasted some time, but I guess we weren't the most talkative group. The only discussion I really didn't like was the review, as hearing other students' ideas didn't help me much in preparing for the midterm.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>He tried to make the best of a bad situation and was very sympathetic.  Always came up with group work and such to keep conversation going in discussion.  It's not his fault the class was a nightmare.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Erin was great! She was a great help at the end of the week after being confused during lecture. She let us know what was important, and we had great discussions.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Chris was great! Very accessible outside of class, deep understanding of the subject, and very helpful with the essays. His discussions could have been deeper, but that was mainly the students' fault. His discussions really helped with understanding the subject.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Chris is very, very nice and highly responsive via email.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Chris Dunlap seemed a bit not engaged with his job, but he was very helpful with class material, and furnished us with more relevant and interesting readings then the ones actually assigned.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Chris is AWESOME! He is so kind and approachable, and really helped me understand the material. He has many great insights on a variety of topics, and led a great discussion group, that for me personally was much more useful than the lectures. I had a great time writing my essays, based on the readings and discussions, without much help from lectures. Chris is the reason this class was meaningful to me.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Chris Dunlap did a great job of adding to the material in lecture and making sure students were prepared for the exams. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Thank God for Erin and Chris. We'd have been lost without them. They did their best to clarify what readings we were supposed to do and what themes we were supposed to get from each week, but it wasn't easy for them to do. I also don't know Tenorio treated them terribly well, based on the few interactions I observed. I could easily be wrong about that, though.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Erin is amazing. She was great at clarifying Tenorio's lectures and leading discussion, and helped us review before the final paper</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Erin helped us clarify what wasn't clear during Tenorio's lectures, which was good. She had trouble engaging the class in discussion -- it was good when she had us divide into groups and discuss things and then present them, but it was hard to have people talk when she asked straight-out questions. She had us do responses to the readings before discussions on Friday -- I think it would help if she directly asked us about our discussion posts and what we said about them -- it would force people to talk and they would be comfortable with it, since they wrote it in the first place. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
			</ul></div>
		
			
				<h3 class="eval-title">What, if anything, what would you change about this course and why?</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
				
			
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>change the professor, less reading, keep the TA graders

The ONLY good thing about this class is that it doesn't have exams, just 2 1250 word midterm papers and a 2500 word final paper. HOWEVER, you only get like 4 days to do them, so you're doing basically nothing but writing papers for an entire weekend, which is kinda ridiculous. But it's still better than having exams, if I had to take tests I most definitely would have failed this class.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Better lecture, they were so bad</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Maybe a bit less reading, it could be overwhelming sometimes. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Have a real syllabus, with readings listed per week and stick to it.  Get rid of these general purpose textbooks and go back to a combination of original sources, specialized textbooks, and scholarly books and papers like in Prof. Kouri's class.  Facundo and the letter from the guy in Mexico City were fine.  Also, enough with these take home essays that ask us to "pretend to be an Indian in Mexico City" or to rewrite the textbook (but you want me to have a thesis?  you're not giving me anything I can build a thesis out of.  How can a letter or a mock newspaper article have a thesis.).  I did the midterm in less than 2 hours.   Absolutely a waste of time, especially after the rigor of Kouri's class</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Less readings! I would have done a lot more and focused better if there were more consise readings. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Better structure of the lectures would make it easier to follow.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Making readings more accessible; choose better readings.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Bakewell, the main textbook, is pretty bad. It makes some weird pedagogical choices that just makes it more confusing, and it is overall a very bland text. The readings from the Cambridge Encyclopedia are a lot better, and maybe they should be chosen rather than Bakewell. Also, I would like the lectures to be more related to the reading or, if not, to actually give relevant insight.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Clearer/more organized lectures.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Erin and Chris were fabulous, as were all my TAs for Latin American Civilizations. But Professor Tenorio is probably the worst lecturer I've had in four years at this school. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Clearer lectures</li>

			<li>It was ok, it never lagged, but mostly we discussed the readings which were dumbed-down and generic.  It was like discussing the contents of a Wikipedia article--once you've covered all the facts, what is left to say?</li>

			<li>Somewhat productive, but the teaching assistant (Chris) did a great job of keeping the conversation flowing, especially when it was clear not many people had done the reading / were to shy to speak up. He was so nice and open to any contribution that it made it easier to speak up. He also made the amount of material much more manageable by splitting us into groups and letting us teach each other.</li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>Not very, but even when civ lecturers are great, that's not unusual. Even still, Chris and Erin had really tough jobs. </li>

			<li>I definitely think about history differently now. I had never been taught Latin American history this way before, and I liked that we learned a lot about and frequently connected European history as well. </li>
		
	
	

	
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<li>It hasn't.   I guess it shows me how low level a college course can really be, even at Uchicago.  The essays were on the same level as "what did you do over the summer" in 5th grade.  This is not an exaggeration and I cannot stress this enough.  There are so many ways to try to create original test materials that people can't just download answers from the internet (or, maybe use Turnitin or some other cheating-prevention software!), which is a legitimate problem, I sympathize, but this method encourages people to slack off and work minimally.  Or just have in-class tests, I am totally ok with that!  I think it worked very well last quarter</li>

			<li>Given me a much more well-rounded view on histories of places besides Europe and the USA, which is frequently all we are taught / talk about. Additionally, learning about this period of Latin American history is crucial to understanding the unique set of problems it faces today.</li>
